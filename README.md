## How to add your own model

### Pack your model in a VDF and upload it to steam workshop
**If you already find a workshop item which contains the models you need, you can skip this part**

Requirements:
- Your own model
- Counter-Strike 2 Workshop Tools (which can be installed in `Steam -> cs2 -> properties -> DLC`)

**Step 1.** Open your cs2 directory, find `game/csgo/gameinfo.gi`,
go to the  end of the file, find `AddonConfig -> VpkDirectories`
. Then add the directory you want to put in the vpk like the following example:


*example*:
```json
AddonConfig	
	{
		"VpkDirectories"
		{
			"exclude"       "maps/content_examples"
			"include"       "maps"
			"include"		"characters" // this is the directory you want to add to the vpk
			"include"       "cfg/maps"
			"include"       "materials"
			"include"       "models"
			"include"       "panorama/images/overheadmaps"
			"include"       "panorama/images/map_icons"
			"include"       "particles"
			"include"       "resource/overviews"
			"include"       "scripts/vscripts"
			"include"       "sounds"
			"include"       "soundevents"
			"include"       "lighting/postprocessing"
			"include"       "postprocess"
			"include"       "addoninfo.txt"
		} 
		"AllowAddonDownload" "1"
		"AllowAddonDownloadForDemos" "1"
		"DisableAddonValidationForDemos" "1"
	}
```

**Step 2.** Launch `Counter-Strike 2 Workshop Tools`, then click `Create New Addon`

**Step 3.** Go to folder `./game/csgo_addons/<your addon name>/` and paste your characters folder to here.

**Step 4.** Open `Asset Browser`, then click the `Tools` button on the top-right corner, open `Counter-Strike 2 Workshop Manager`

**Step 5.** Click `New` button in the `Counter-Strike 2 Workshop Manager`, fill in all the information, and publish it.

**Step 6.** After verification, you should be able to use the workshop item.

### Setup MultiAddonManager

## Common Issues

- **You should use `.vmdl` instead of `.vmdl_c` in config json**
